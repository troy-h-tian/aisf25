This is an application for the ACM AI AISF program for Winter 2025/26.

## SRC
Source files, namely the script used to train the walker as well as the script used to evaluate the true score of a given model by giving a 10-episode exam (absent scaling from reward wrappers).

## Models

A few of my trained brains, in zip files.

## Experiments

YAML files with values that were used for ablation studies and experiments over the course of the model's training.

## Results

- GIFs: A few GIFs of results.

- Plots: Several informative plots (taken from the writeup) from some of the more impactful ablation studies I conducted.

## Writeup

My writeup as a PDF (the proper GIF can be found in the GIFs folder).
